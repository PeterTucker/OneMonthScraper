OneMonth Video Scraper
------------------
I wanted to be able to refer to a OneMonth course's videos in the future.
Unfortunately, OneMonth does not allow you to do that because their subscription model.
So, I made this scraper to download the videos so I have them locally.

Be sure to fill out your EMAIL, PASSWORD, and which course you're subscribed to.
Install the newest version Selenium
Install Beautiful Soup
Firefox must be installed in order to use it as a Web Driver.
